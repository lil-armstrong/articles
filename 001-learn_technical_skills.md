# How to learn a technical skill

1. Know the subject and scope
2. Establish a goal with metrics
3. Use multiple resources
4. Play around and find out what's important
5. Do not learn too much upfront. Use natural curiousity
6. Take what you learn and teach it to someone. Its a place where learning changes from knowledge to understanding

## Learn by reading backwards:

One way to learn a concept is by reading the meaning or definition backwards. Example: Let's consider the following definition:

> Computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and relating these classes to each other.

We can read it backwards to be as:

> When you relate and classify problems that involve computation according to resource usage, You are practising the Theory of complexity in computation

We can also paraphrase as follows:

> The theory of complexity in computation is a field that focuses on classification of problems in computation based on use of resource and their relationship with one another

## The problem of the solution and the solution of the problem

One way to build a conscious mindset that first identifies a problem before engaging in finding the solution, is to remember that every solution has a problem. This is not necessarily true for the reverse. So to understand a solution, you need to understand the problem it was solving.
