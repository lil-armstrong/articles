# Theory of computational complexity
Focuses on the classification of compitational problems by their resource usage and relationship with one another. The complexity of a computational problem is a measure of how much resource it requires to be computed. There are various ways or metrics that are used to measure computational complexities. They include: storage, time, communication (communication complexity), gates (circuit complexity) and the number of processors (parallel computing).

One of the primary role of this theory is to determine the practical limits of the computer.
